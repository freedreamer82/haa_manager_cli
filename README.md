# HAA Manager CLI

  
The simplest solution to handle [HAA](https://github.com/RavenSystem/esp-homekit-devices) devices in Home Assistant is to add extra pairing in HAA Setup mode adding them to ios controller besides HA : In this way you can use HAA Manager App in parallel to Home Assistant.(That's the way I suggest you).

For those who don't want extra pairing there is HAA Manager CLI.


# How to Install
 
HAA Manager CLI needs some sudo privileges for some features (scan network i.e).
It's not mandatory, is up to you.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

or

`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`


# Get Pairing Data From Home Assistant

HAA Manager CLI needs pairing data to work.You can find these info in 

`HA_CONFIG_FOLDER/.storage/core.config_entries`

you must copy them and create a pairing-file.json in the form:

```
{
        "alias1": {
          "AccessoryPairingID": "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx",
          "AccessoryLTPK": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "iOSPairingId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "iOSDeviceLTSK": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "iOSDeviceLTPK": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "AccessoryIP": "192.168.1.77",
          "AccessoryPort": 5556,
          "Connection": "IP"
        },
        "alias2": {
          "AccessoryPairingID": "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx",
          "AccessoryLTPK": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "iOSPairingId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "iOSDeviceLTSK": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "iOSDeviceLTPK": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
          "AccessoryIP": "192.168.1.77",
          "AccessoryPort": 5556,
          "Connection": "IP"
        }
}
```

alias1..alias2 etc are only aliases for the devices : give them different names for each item.

# Scan

Scan Mode allows to discover devices (already paired in Home Assistant) in your network.

`sudo python haa_manager_cli.py -f pairing-file.json -e scan`


```

You can also see if any device (from your pairing file) is in Setup Mode.

# Update

For all operations you must use the name discovered with the scan.

`python haa_manager_cli.py -f pairing-file.json -e update -n HAA-AABBCC`

```

20:33:09,ERROR HAA-12345 NOT online..! means that in the paring file there is the device BUT it's not online during the scan.
